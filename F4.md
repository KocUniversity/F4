1. Given the questionable reliability of chat services, a certain professor, let's call him Prof. CrazyMuch with some connections and little need for sleep, gets a hold of WhazApp chat messages of the students from his class. Much to his disappointment, there are some students who are planning to hire someone to solve the exam for them in exchange of money. He wants to find them but the messages are too long to process by reading. He decides to write a script which will automatically detect suspicious keywords such as money, fee, pay, hire, etc. What he wants out of the script is the name of the person writing the message and the date and time of the message to use in the court. (Yes, the court! Check the next question for details.)

Please find a snippet of WhazApp chat history in the file called "WhazApp Chat with Comp 101 (use hooli).txt" to see the format of messages on this platform. Use regular expressions and capture groups to detect the lines with one or more of the following keywords:

> `money`, `fee`, `pay`, `pays`, `hire`, `hires` 

to automatically extract the information for Prof. CrazyMuch. This information should include the name of the person who sent the message as well as the date and time the message was sent.

* First use `grep` with regular expressions to find the lines with the keywords and `echo` it to a file called "keywords.txt". 
* Note that you need to use quotation marks around the filename since there are spaces in it.
* Then `cat` that file, pipe its output to `sed`. You need the exact format of the line and three capture groups corresponding to date, time, and the name.

For the example snippet given, the output should be as follows:

> 12/18/20 7:53 PM Cersei
  12/19/20 4:34 PM Cersei
  12/19/20 4:34 PM Jaime

**Hint**: You need the escape character `\` to be able to refer to the forward slash `/`, i.e. do `\/` to match the forward slash `/`.

2. According to laws in Turkey, this action is considered a crime, specifically referred to as *dolandırıcılık* (fraud) or *nitelikli dolandırıcılık* (certified fraud). By examining the text of the news about the matter ("news.txt"), your task is to find the relevant line and extract the punishment as the number of years in jail automatically from the text. 

* The sentence should include the name of the crime in Turkish either as *dolandırıcılık* or *nitelikli dolandırıcılık*. 

* After the name of the crime in quotation marks, there is a text following before the punishment: " suçu işleyenlere " surrounded by a single space character on both sides.

* In Turkish, the punishment is typically announced using a certain type of phrase:

> 2 yıldan 7 yıla kadar

This means "from 2 years to 7 years" in jail. Find the part of the sentence for both types of crimes, extract the minimum and maximum years and echo this sentence for each crime as a warning to criminals in all CAPS:

> IS IT REALLY WORTH SPENDING 2 TO 7 YEARS OF YOUR LIFE IN JAIL FOR THIS?

* First do `grep` to extract the part with the name of the crime and `echo` it to a file.
* Note that you need to use quotation marks around the crime if there are spaces in it, e.g. "nitelikli dolandırıcılık".
* Then `cat` that file, pipe its output to `sed`. You need the exact format as explained and two capture groups corresponding to min and max years.

**Hint**: In order to avoid printing lines that do not match, you can use the combination of

* `-n` option which tells `sed` not to print
* `p` flag which tells `sed` to print what is matched

`sed -E -n 's/.../.../p'`

**Hint2**: If you do not have Turkish characters in your keyboard, you can copy the parts with Turkish characters from the file or the explanation.
